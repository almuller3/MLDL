## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification tasks. Vision Transformers have gained popularity for their ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.

## Model Architecture

The Vision Transformer model consists of several key components:

1. **Patch Embedding**: The input image is divided into patches, and each patch is linearly embedded.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Positional information is added to the patch embeddings to retain spatial information.
3. **Transformer Encoder**: A stack of Transformer encoder layers processes the embeddings.
4. **Classification Head**: The output from the Transformer is passed through a classification head for final predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is [specify dataset source here]. It consists of images labeled into various categories.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vit-implementation.git
    cd vit-implementation
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the Vision Transformer model, execute the following command:

```bash
python vit_converted.py
