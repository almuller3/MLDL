# PyTorch GAN Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch. The project demonstrates how to build, train, and visualize GANs, a class of machine learning models designed to generate realistic synthetic data.

## Dataset
Used Celeba

## Project Overview

This project is focused on implementing a basic GAN using PyTorch. The notebook walks through the steps of building the generator and discriminator models, setting up the training loop, and visualizing the generated results.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib ipython
