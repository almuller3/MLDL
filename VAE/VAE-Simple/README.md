# Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on MNIST

This repository contains the implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) using PyTorch. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. VAEs are a class of generative models that learn to encode data into a latent space and then decode it back to reconstruct the original data.

## Overview

The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is a generative model that learns a probabilistic mapping of input data to a latent space, and from this latent space, it reconstructs the input data. VAEs are particularly useful for generating new data samples, dimensionality reduction, and learning interpretable latent representations.

This project includes:

- A PyTorch implementation of the VAE.
- Training on the MNIST dataset.
- Visualization of the latent space and generated samples.

## Model Architecture

### Encoder
- **Input**: 784-dimensional vector (flattened 28x28 image).
- **Layers**:
  - Fully connected layer (784 -> 512).
  - Two separate fully connected layers for the mean (`mu`) and log-variance (`logvar`) of the latent space.
- **Output**: Mean and log-variance vectors for the latent space.

### Reparameterization Trick
- Samples a latent vector `z` from the distribution defined by the mean (`mu`) and log-variance (`logvar`), ensuring that the network can backpropagate through the stochastic sampling process.

### Decoder
- **Input**: Latent vector `z`.
- **Layers**:
  - Fully connected layer (latent_dim -> 512).
  - Fully connected layer (512 -> 784).
- **Output**: Reconstructed image (784-dimensional vector).

### Loss Function
- **Reconstruction Loss**: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss between the original and reconstructed images.
- **KL Divergence Loss**: Regularization term that forces the learned latent distribution to be close to a standard normal distribution.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch 1.6+
- torchvision
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vae-mnist.git
    cd vae-mnist
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

You can run the VAE model on the MNIST dataset by executing the following command:

```bash
python train_vae.py

## improving-the-model

Here are some strategies to enhance the performance and quality of the VAE:

Increase Model Depth: Add more layers or units to the encoder and decoder.
Use Convolutional Layers: Replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers to better capture spatial information in images.
Adjust Latent Dimensionality: Experiment with the size of the latent space to balance compression and information retention.
Beta-VAE: Introduce a beta parameter to control the weight of the KL Divergence term in the loss function, allowing for more disentangled latent representations.
Regularization: Use techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting.

## Results
After training, the VAE should be able to generate new digit images by sampling from the learned latent space. Additionally, you can visualize the distribution of the latent space and how it maps to the data. Example visualizations are generated during training and include:

Latent Space Visualization: A 2D plot showing how different digit classes are arranged in the latent space.
Generated Samples: New digit images generated by decoding random samples from the latent space.
