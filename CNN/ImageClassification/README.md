## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to classify images into different categories using a CNN model. CNNs are a class of deep neural networks that have proven very effective for image classification tasks.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of several layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features and make final predictions.
4. **Output Layer**: Uses softmax activation to output class probabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images from [specify dataset source here]. Each image belongs to one of several predefined classes.
